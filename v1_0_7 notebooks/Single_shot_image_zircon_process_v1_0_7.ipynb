Zircon segmentation is accomplished via trained Mask RCNN model, using the Detectron2 deep learning library. Images for segmentation will ideally have been saved with scaling metadata files during LA-ICP-MS dating (e.g., at the UCSB LASS facility), but scaling information for images can be added manually for non-standardized images.\n",
