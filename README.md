# colab_zirc_dims
This repository contains code allowing measurement of the dimensions of zircons from LA-ICP-MS alignment images using Google Colab, w/ or w/o aid of RCNN segmentation. Because processing is done in Google Colab, this method should be available to anyone with an internet connection. [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) was used for model training and is used for Colab implementation.

## Features
The code in this repo enables organization (e.g., matching zircon mosaic images to .scancsv scanlists), data extraction (e.g., mapping shots to subimages of mosaics), and post-segmentation processing (e.g., extracting accurate zircon dimensions from segmentation masks) of mosaic-scanlist datasets. Said code currently only supports processing of images and scanlists from the [UA LaserChron Center](https://sites.google.com/laserchron.org/arizonalaserchroncenter/home), but may be updated in the ~near future to support processing of datasets from other LA-ICP-MS geochron facilities. RCNN instance segmentation of zircons is handled by Detectron2 and implemented in ready-to-run Google Colab Notebooks (see 'Links').

In datasets with good image quality and well exposed zircons (e.g., with full cross-sections visible above puck(s)), automated processing achieves measurements comparable to those produced by humans (with net error along long and short axes < .5 μm vs. humans in several tested datasets) in a fraction of the time. See below for an example analysis of a single spot.

| Analysis | Area (µm^2) | Eccentricity | Perimeter (µm) | Major axis length (µm) | Minor axis length (µm) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Spot 315 | 2227.648    | 0.899        | 193.0          | 80.7                   | 35.4                   |

In sub-optimal datasets, automated processing is less successful and can produce inaccurate segmentations. To mitigate this, a semi-automated Colab-based GUI that allows users to view and edit automatically-generated segmentations before export has also been implemented.

Various functions for processing mosaic image datasets are available in modules **mos_match** and **mos_proc**.

## Project Status (updated 11/02/2021)
- This is still a work in progress, though all features are functional. Bugs surely exist, and are most likely to be encountered when using the package outside of the provided Notebooks
- Model training/improvement is ongoing, and new, better-performing models will be made available in the near future.
- module **mos_match** has full docstring documentation.
- module **mos_proc** needs cleanup and docstring documentation.
- module **zirc_dims_GUI** is sort of a horror-show of code, but a functional one. I won't touch this until other modules are in great condition and/or I have a lot of free time.

## Additional Notes
- Training and large-n zircon measurment datasets for this project were provided Ryan Leary (New Mexico Tech). Also, motivation; see his [recent work](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JB019226) on the utility of augmenting LA-ICP-MS data with grain size data for more information.
- Some additional training data is from the [UCSB Petrochronology Center](https://www.petrochronology.com/).
- Although models were trained on (and tests have only been performed on) detrital zircon mosaic images, I think that this method could probably be applied to LA-ICP-MS mosaics/samples of other minerals (e.g., monazite).
- I do plan to write this project up into some sort of publication (journal article, conference paper, conference poster, vanity license plate, etc). At that point, I will post citation info here. If you submit a publication utilizing this code in the meantime, please reach out to me.
- Any suggestions, comments, or questions about this project are also welcome.
